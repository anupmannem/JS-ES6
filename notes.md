# Closures

First building block for closure is `Scope`

_Scope_ is a way of describing which variables are available in different contexts within an application.

Types of Scope

-   Global
    -   global variables are declared out the function scope
    -   and are accessible anywhere
-   Local
    -   local variables are created within a function
    -   and are available only in that function

Second building block for closure is `Nested functions`

_Nested functions_ is declaring a function within another function

Third building block for closure is `Returning a value(reference) from a function`

A function that creates a closure is that it can create references to multiple closedover variables that are independent of each other.

_closures_ enable us to create not just a single set of type of variables, but as many distinct references to copies of those private variables.
