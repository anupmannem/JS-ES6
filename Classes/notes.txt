functions vs classes
functions
	- can be hoisted
	- can be overwritten
classes
	- can not be hoisted
	- can't be overwritten

constructors
	- if not written, automatically created
	- only one constructor per class	
	- keyword super allows to call methods from parents class

Mixins
	- when you want to extend more than one class into a single class
	- this is a pattern favoring composition over inheritence
