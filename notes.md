# Closures

First building block of closure is `Scope`

_Scope_ is a way of describing which variables are available in different contexts within an application.

Types of Scope

-   Global
    -   global variables are declared out the function scope
    -   and are accessible anywhere
-   Local
    -   local variables are created within a function
    -   and are available only in that function
